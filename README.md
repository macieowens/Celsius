## Exercise 1:

Create a static class called TempConverter. 

The class should have at least 2 methods, one called FahrenheitToCelsius that will require a double as a parameter and return a double, the other CelsiusToFahrenheit which will also require a double as a parameter and return a double.

Fill out these methods and call them in your Program.cs file. Make sure theyâ€™re accurate!
